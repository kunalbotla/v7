I was elected as a delegate to the 2022 MassDems Convention today!

I'm honored to be closen by the other Democrats of Lexington and intend to attend the convention at the DCU Center in Worcester this June.

I'd love to hear from other teenagers and Lexington residents about their thoughts on candidates.
