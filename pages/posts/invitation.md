**in massachusetts?** i'd love to meet sometime!
**somewhere over the horizon of the web?** we can still (virtually) meet!

i've built much of my work on cold emailing and calling and would love to help others the way many people have helped me.

please send me an email to set a time and place. i love receving messages and can be reached at kunal@kunalbotla.com and kunal@projectboom.org, feel free to use either or the more relevant one.

unfortunately, at the moment i'm pretty busy with other projects so i likely can't be involved unless it relates directly to project boom or hack club, however, i'd still be open to considering if you reach out.
