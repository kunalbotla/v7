# Kunal Botla

**Hey,** Iâ€™m the founder of [Project Boom](https://projectboom.org), a student at [Lexington High School](https://lhs.lexingtonma.org), and an alum of [Acera School](https://aceraschool.org), a member of the [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) community, along with various other things. I'm passionate about technology especially financially and functionally accessible technology.

This website is my primary digital presence and links to all my other major ones.

Please reach out to me if you're intersted in talking! I love hearing from others and working on projects together. Take a look at my [standing invitation](/posts/invitation).

This website is still a work-in-progress and will be continuously updated.
