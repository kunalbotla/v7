# Kunal Botla

**Hey!** Iâ€™m the lead organizer of [MAHacks](https://mahacks.com?ref=kunal), founder of [Project Boom](https://projectboom.org), an operations & engineering team member of [Hack Club Bank](https://hackclub.com/bank/), member of the [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/slack) community, a student at [NuVu Studio](https://nuvustudio.org) in Cambridge, and an alum of [Acera School](https://aceraschool.org), along with various other things. I'm passionate about photography, transit, and technology; especially financially and functionally accessible technology, and I'm currently trying to get into film photography. 

I was formerly a student at [Lexington High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexington_High_School_(Massachusetts)), a [LexDebate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexington_High_School_(Massachusetts)#Debate) team member, ROLL at Lincoln Labs FTC member, and a bunch of other things.

[MAHacks VI](https://mahacks.com?ref=kunal) is happening from March 19-20, 2022. Registration, sponsorship, and mentor opportunities are now open & limited!

[Hack Club Bank](https://hackclub.com/bank/) is the platform for students to make ideas real. Events and nonprofit projects across the world are hosted on Bank. Get started at [hackclub.com/bank](https://hackclub.com/bank/).

Please reach out to me if you're intersted in talking! I love hearing from others and working on projects together. Take a look at my [standing invitation](/posts/invitation).

This website is my primary digital presence and links to all my other major ones; it is continuously a work-in-progress and will be continually updated.
