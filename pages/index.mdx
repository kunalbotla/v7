# Kunal Botla

**Hey,** Iâ€™m the founder of [Project Boom](https://projectboom.org), an operations & engineering team member of [Hack Club Bank](https://hackclub.com/bank/), member of the [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/slack) community, a student at [NuVu Studio](https://nuvustudio.org) in Cambridge, and an alum of [Acera School](https://aceraschool.org), along with various other things. I'm passionate about technology; especially financially and functionally accessible technology, and I occasionally take photos. 

[Hack Club Bank](https://hackclub.com/bank/) is the platform for students to make ideas real. Events and nonprofit projects across the world are hosted on Bank. Get started at [hackclub.com/bank](https://hackclub.com/bank/).

Please reach out to me if you're intersted in talking! I love hearing from others and working on projects together. Take a look at my [standing invitation](/posts/invitation).

This website is my primary digital presence and links to all my other major ones.

This website is continuously a work-in-progress and will be continually updated.
