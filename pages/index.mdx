# Kunal Botla

**Hey,** I’m the founder of [Project Boom](https://projectboom.org), an Opperations team member of [Hack Club Bank](https://hackclub.com/bank/), member of the [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) community, a student at [Lexington High School](https://lhs.lexingtonma.org), and an alum of [Acera School](https://aceraschool.org), along with various other things. I'm passionate about technology especially financially and functionally accessible technology.

[Hack Club Bank](https://hackclub.com/bank/) is a platform for students to make ideas real. Events and nonprofit projects across the world are hosted on Bank. Get start at [hackclub.com/bank](https://hackclub.com/bank/).

Please reach out to me if you're intersted in talking! I love hearing from others and working on projects together. Take a look at my [standing invitation](/posts/invitation).

This website is my primary digital presence and links to all my other major ones.

This website is continuously a work-in-progress and will be continually updated.
